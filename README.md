The variables Vehicle Length, Vehicle Weight, and Ground Clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the Miles Per Gallon values in the dataset.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. If the measure is on the total amount of coils then they are within compliance. However, if the measure is based off of the seperate lots, then Lot number 3 falls outside of the compliant range with a variance of over 170.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

The t-tests for the Total Group, Lot 1, and Lot 2 don't provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, the mean can be reasonably said to be 1500. Now, as for Lot 3 there is a harder case to make for the null hypothesis, but I feel that is is still close enough that 1500 can be seen as an approximate mean.
